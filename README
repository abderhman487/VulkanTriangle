# Vulkan Triangle Renderer in C

This repository implements a triangle renderer using Vulkan in C.

## What I implemented in this project:

1. GLFW window creation
2. Vulkan initialization
3. Instance creation
4. Validation layers setup
5. Physical device selection
6. Logical device and queue family selection
7. Surface and swapchain creation
8. Image views and framebuffers
9. Render pass
10. Graphics pipeline
11. Command pool and command buffers
12. Main loop
13. Proper cleanup


I used https://vulkan-tutorial.com as a reference,
as well as the official Vulkan documentation:
https://docs.vulkan.org/

The implementation is written in C instead of C++.

## Tools

- gcc
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW
- C standard libraries
- glslc (for compiling shaders)

## Build and Run

git clone https://github.com/abderhman487/VulkanTriangle.git
cd VulkanTriangle
make vulkan
make test
