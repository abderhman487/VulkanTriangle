In this repo I have implemented a triangle using vulkan in C language.

what I've implemented through this journey:
  1- GLFW Window creation
  2- Initialize Vulkan
  3- Instance creation
  4- Validation layers for debugging
  5- physical device selection
  6- Logical device and queue families
  7- Window surface and swap chain
  8- Image views and framebuffers
  9- Render passes
  10- Graphics pipeline
  11- Command pools and command buffers
  12- Main loop
  13- Cleanup

I used this tutorial as reference https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ But I used C language in implementation not C++.

Tools:
  1- gcc
  2- Vulkan SDK
  3- GLFW
  4- GLM
  5- C standard libraries
  6- glslc to compile shaders
